### Note to self, future self, other self

Naming convention:
- `resized` (2000 px wide) around 1-2 MB
- `small` (800px wide) around 200 KB
- `unwatermarked` without signature

Then realised it is faster to introduce a new convention:
- `bg` (same as resized)
- `sm` (sama as small)
- `-` dashes in the name because less hassle with adding spaces
